The goal of the project was to classify each street as **0** or **1** based on availability of parking spots.  

The codes for different models can be found [here](https://github.com/arpitaj5/Parking_SF) and the report explaining the dataset and the approach for prediction is present [here](https://github.com/arpitaj5/Parking_SF/blob/master/Report.pdf).
